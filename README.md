The famous Dining Philosophers problem consists of the eating-thinking cycle. Knowing this, the entrepreneur opened a place called DinoPhilo. There are 10 round tables. Each table is for 8 people. Customer acceptance is in the form of a philosopher group of 8, and each group is taken to a table. (All members has to sit same table) When the place is full, the arriving groups are put on hold outside. The group that eats their food gets up and table is cleared, and the table is immediately set for the next group. At each table opening, there is 2 kilos of rice in the large rice pot in the middle. Each philosopher eats 100 grams of rice in each eating and thinking cycle. When the rice in the pot is finished, if there is a philosopher who cannot eat even a bite in the group of 8 people, the group orders the waiter to freshen the pot (2 kilos) without leaving the table, and the eating-thinking cycle starts again. When the rice is finished, this cycle continues if there is still no food since the first session on the table. When everyone at the table has eaten more or less, the group leaves without paying the bill (accounts on me).
